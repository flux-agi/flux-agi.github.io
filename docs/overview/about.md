# What is Flux

Flux is a spiking neural network engine and a GUI editor, that is built to streamline the research and development of AGI. It is a convenient and powerful tool for discovering various biologically inspired circuits behaviors. It can be used in robotics, computational tasks. Main features are:
* Zero-code circuit prototyping
* Nested circuit structure
* Real time updated. See how your modification change the overall network dynamics
* Extensions for off-circuit computations, called organs
* Generators for rapidly generating large-scale network in a biological fashion
* Synapses for single connections and fibers for multiple connections

## Motivation

We believe that to transcend human intelligence, we first need to reverse engineer the brain. We believe that the real intelligence is hidden in a complex recursive dynamic behavior of neural networks. Large scale neural networks exibit a highly complex dynamical behavior, that is hard to quantify and visualize. With Flux editor it is easy to prototype networks and simulate the behavior

## Principles that we follow
* We do not need to strictly follow the biology. We are building a plane, not a mechanical bird
* We dont need to repeat biological redundancy.

## Engine
Current version comes with a Javascript spiking engine, but in future we want to extend to other engines like Nest, SpiNNakker and others available.
