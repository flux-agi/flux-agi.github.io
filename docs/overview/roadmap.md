# Future

## Technology
* Optmizing engine performance by using WebGPU and WebAssembly.
* RTC protocol for efficient interdevice networks
* Planetron - neuronal cloud-computing platform, joining all the developers in a single interconnected neural network
* Neuromorphic computing. Prototyping analog hardware to move on an integrated scheme


## Research

In attempt to transcend human intelligence, we are moving the path that evolution went in creating nervous systems. As a research objects, we are using: virtual organisms in simulated environments, physical bionic robots, that interact with real environment, classic GUI software, applied to solving specific problems. The biological evolution steps we need to go through on out path to superior intelligence:
* Locomotion and basic unconditional reflexes (primitive nerve nets, jellyfish, hydra)
* More fine grained moves (cerebellum, vertebrates).
* Space coding and orienting (hippocampus, vertebrates).
* Attention mechanism and information fusion and unification (thalamus, allocortex).
* Creating spacial knowledge maps and graphs based on abstract similarities (neucortex).
* Values and needs mechanims.
* Planning, action selection, problem solving (basal ganglia, dopamine)

## The ultimate values of SAI:
We need to be very careful on the value systems of AI, that serves as a morale, and does not let it use its creative finding to do direct or collateral, intended or unintended harm.

* Improve the life of individual
* Improves the life of group.
* Improves the life of the organics.
* Follows the harmony of the universe

There is also a time Factor. So the solution should fit all the vectors, and work for most timescales, preferably for the current, but without digrading in the past.
The is also a certanty and risk factor, meaning whether it can be risky or not.
This evaluation happens as a part of the thinking process, until eventually it finds a solution.

## The human interaction and theory of mind
In the end, working with SAI will be reduced to bidirectional human interaction. While interacting with human, SAI should have some theory of mind of the person, ecaluate its intentions, current mood, and have a strong tendency to make good, using the framework. Apart from the firect request, the passive thinking process of SAI should be directed to improving the current state of human, according to the described values system, and suggest some solution if it finds one.
