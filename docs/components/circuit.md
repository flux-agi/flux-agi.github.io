# Circuit

Circuit is the base unit of the network in flux. It is the collection of nodes and connections between them. In a lowest level, it is just a set of neurons and synapses. Everything that happens lives on the circuit. Circuit can be grouped, nested, shared and saved as a prototype to be reused further. It is a powerful tool to create nested structures.

## Circuit properties

## Nesting circuits

## Inheriting circuits

## Circuit files

Circuit data is stored in the binary, with .flx extension. In makes sure it is well optimized and loadable to hardware systems. In case of the organ dependencies, they also can be ported as executables with wasm, and loaded to any standalone system.
