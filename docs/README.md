# What is Flux

Flux is a artificial nervous system engine with GUI editor, created to streamline the research and development of AGI and bionic robotics. Main features are:
* Biologically close, yet computationally efficient neurons and synapses
* Allows for direct transmission and modulation
* Biologically accurate learning process
* Zero-code network prototyping
* Save functional circuits as components, group, nest and reuse components
* Create deep nested architectures of any complexity
* Real time updates. See how your modification change the overall network dynamics
* Extensions for inputs, outputs and off-circuit computations
* Generators for rapidly bootstrapping large-scale network in a genetic fashion
* Synapses for single connections and fibers for multiple connections
* Reusability, composability and inheritance: treat nervous system as a software
* Intuitive IDE
* Efficient: GPU powered shader computations and Rust memory management.
* Community: share researches and circuits, gain and share inspiration.
* Powerful extension mechanism, that allows to add any input, output and non-neuronal computations to the system

> Flux aims to be a foundational technology for AGI, giving a performant framework and IDE for the new type of software, to power the new field of robotics and AI, that can run on mass-market machines and scale horizontally.
## Motivation

Nervous systems evolved for billions of years, adapting to the chanding environment and growing complexity for the organisms. The pinnacle of this process is the human intelligence, but still, it is limited with biology. All this evolutionary findings are coded in the 8000 genes in our DNA, meaning that intellect can be converged to a set of engineering finding, coded in ~50kb of genetic information. The goal of FLUX is to provide a toolset, same as evolution had, that will help us reverse engineer intelligence, following the evolutionary path. Solving the same problems with help of vistual systems and robotics, we will be able to rediscover this patterns using engeneering approach and implement them in a reliable and versatile digital systems to eventually transcend human intelligence.

**Along the path to superior intelligence, the functional findings can be used both in applied digital systems and robotics, powering a new field of technology that we call cognitronics.**

## AGI - the final invention

The master goal of Flux is to create a superior intelligence, without biological limitations, that acts according to morale, and uses its computational power to the benefit of humanity. By moving in a way that biological evolution goes, we can eventually get to a place where we can transcend human intelligence.
## Artificial life forms

Robotix is a way to mimic the behaviour of living species, creating agents that operate in the real environment. With FLUX, we can use artificial nervous systems for a completely new approach, and create a true versatile and independent artificial lifeforms, that are guided by an intristic activirt of the nervous systems, rather then set of programming rules. They can learn, adapt and solve various array of tasks in a biological fashion.
## Platform independence, performance and unlimited scale

We want every person to be able to leverage the power of Flux on every machine. Flux is build in the browser, leveraging the power of new WebGPU and WebAssembly standards. Being a browser app gives us the true cross-platform option and P2P communication out of box. New standards of WebGPU and WebAssembly allow us to leverage all the power of modern mass-market machines. The nature of neural based computation has a tremendous applications for cloud-computing. Users can connect any number of machines to macro-circuits, to power cloud-computing and achieve tremendous computational powers without supercomputers.

## Co-exploring

The whole history of scientific discovery is a synergy of human minds. Flux is built around cooperation. Researchers can share components and extentions with community and use others work in your projects, add descriptions using markdown WYSIWYG editor, create and share complete researches, and get feedback from another users in the comments and threads. Learn with the others, share your discoveries and more, lets solve intelligence together!.

## Neuromorphic hardware

The computational patterns, found using Flux, can be recreated in silicon and used as a base for new generation of neuromorphic hardware, to make brain-like executions more efficient.
