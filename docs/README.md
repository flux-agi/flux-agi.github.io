# What is Flux

Flux is an artificial nervous system engine with a GUI editor, created to streamline the research and development of AGI and bionic robotics. The main features are:
* Neurons and synapses that are biologically close but computationally efficient
* Mechanism of neural modulation for network dynamics variability
* Biologically accurate Hebbian learning process
* Zero-code network design
* Modularity: circuits can be nested, grouped, and inherited
* Real-time updates: changes are reflected immediately without pausing execution
* Comprehensive extension mechanism for input, output, and non-neural computations
* Generic generators for rapidly bootstrapping large-scale networks
* Easy-to-use, full-featured IDE
* GPU powered shader computations and Rust memory management
* Co-exploring: share your findings and use other developers solutions in your networks

> Flux aims to be a foundational technology for AGI, giving a performant framework and IDE for the new type of software, to power the new field of AI systems and robotics
## Motivation

For billions of years, nervous systems have evolved to adapt to changing environments and the complexity of organisms. The pinnacle of this process is the human intellect. All these evolutionary findings are encoded in the 8000 genes in our DNA, meaning that intellect is literally a set of engineering rules, coded in ~50kb of genetic information. The goal of FLUX is to provide a toolset that will allow developers to reverse engineer intelligence, following the evolutionary path. With the help of virtual agents and robotics, we will be able to rediscover these patterns using an engineering approach and implement them in reliable and versatile digital systems.

**On the path to superior intelligence, those engineering findings can be used both in applied digital systems and robotics, powering a new field of technology that we call cognitronics.**

## AGI - the final invention

The master goal of FLUX is to create a superior intelligence, without biological limitations, that acts according to "moral values" and uses its creative power to the benefit of humanity. By moving in the way that biological evolution goes, we can eventually get to a place where we can transcend human intelligence.
## Artificial life forms

Robotics is a way to mimic the behavior of a living species in real environments. With FLUX, we can use artificial nervous systems for a completely new type of robots that are guided by the internal activity of biologically inspired nervous systems rather than a set of programming rules. They can learn, adapt, and solve a diverse array of tasks in a way real organisms do, but without any biological limitations.
## Platform independence, performance and unlimited scale

Flux is built as a Typescript application, leveraging the power of the new WebGPU and WebAssembly standards. It is truly cross-platform and has first-class support for P2P communication. The nature of neural-based computation has tremendous prospects for cloud-computing. With FLUX we don't need supercomputers but can connect any number of mass-market machines to macro-circuits and scale horizontally without any limitations.

## Ecosystem and co-exploring

The whole history of scientific discovery is a synergy of human knowledge and creative potential. Flux is built around cooperation. Researchers can share components and extensions with the community and use the work of other members in their projects in a plug-and-play fashion. The modular component architecture of FLUX is fine-tuned for a large ecosystem of open-source components, just like there is in the programming community. Besides this, it is possible to create and share complete research, and get feedback from other users in the comments and threads. **Lets solve intelligence together!**
