# What is Flux

Flux is a artificial nervous system engine with GUI editor, purposed to streamline the research and development of AGI and bionic robotics. Main features are:
* Biologically close, yet computationally efficient neurons and synapses
* Allows for direct transmission and modulation
* Biologically accurate learning process
* Zero-code network prototyping
* Group, nest and reuse components
* Real time updates. See how your modification change the overall network dynamics
* Extensions for inputs, outputs and off-circuit computations
* Generators for rapidly bootstrapping large-scale network in a genetic fashion
* Synapses for single connections and fibers for multiple connections
* Reusability, composability and inheritance: treat nervous system as a software
* Intuitive IDE
* Efficient: GPU powered shader computations and Rust memory management.
* Community: share researches and circuits, gain and share inspiration.
## Motivation

Nervous systems evolved for billions of years, adapting to the chanding environment and growing complexity for the organisms. The pinnacle of this process is the human intelligence, but still, it is limited with biology. All this findings are coded in the 8000 genes in our DNA, meaning that intellect is acrtually a set of various engineering rules. The goal of FLUX is to create a toolset, that will help us follow this path, by solving the same problems with help of vistual systems and robotics, to rediscover this patterns using engeneering approach and implement them in a reliable and versatile digital systems to eventually transcend human intelligence.

Along the path to higher intelligence, this patterns can be used both in applied systems and robotics, powering a new field of technology that we call cognitronics.

## Artificial life forms

Robotix is a way to mimic the behaviour of living species. With FLUX, we can use artificial nervous systems for a completely new approach, and create a true versatile and independent artificial lifeforms, that can learn, adapt and solve various array of tasks in a completely biological fashion.

## AGI

By moving in a way that biological evolution goes, we can eventually get to a place where we can transcend human intelligence.
## Co-exploring

The whole history of science discovery is a synergy of human minds. Flux is built around cooperation. You can share your findings, add descriptions and get feedback from another users, create circuits and extensions and share it. Learn with the others, share your discoveries and more.

## Cross-platform and performant

We want every person to be able to leverage the power of Flux on every machine. Flux is build in the browser, which gives us the true cross-platform option and P2P communication out of box. New standards of WebGPU and WebAssembly allow us to leverage all the power of modern mass-market machines, and the network specific allows to connect any number of machines ofer the network, to power cloud-computing and achieve tremendous computational powers without supercomputers.

## Principles that we follow
* We do not need to strictly follow the biology. We are building a plane, not a mechanical bird
* We dont need to repeat biological and leverage the stability of the digital systems

## Engine
Current version comes with a Javascript spiking engine, but in future we want to extend to other engines like Nest, SpiNNakker and others available.
